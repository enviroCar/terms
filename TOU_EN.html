Please note, it may be possible to draw conclusions about the author without this information. The data itself may contain such individual characteristics that a relationship to specific persons is obvious. For example, this is the case when a rare type of vehicle moves between a person’s living and working locations and this person is known to have this type of vehicle.To complicate such conclusions, there is an option to adjust the data recording so that it starts and ends with a minimum distance or duration from the start or destination of your journey.<br><br><br>
