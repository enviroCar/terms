<h2>Recording and Publication of your Driving Data</h2>
<h3>a) Recording driving data with the help of the smartphone app</h3>
<p>When recording your driving data, the smartphone collects and stores the following data:
<ul>
<li>Date and time of measurements</li>
<li>GPS position, GPS speed, GPS direction, quality metrics (HDOP, PDOP, VDOP)</li>
<li>Reference to the vehicle type used: vehicle manufacturer, model, year of manufacture, displacement, fuel type</li>
<li>Technical data from your vehicle's engine control, such as: speed, revolutions per minute, engine load, air mass flow, intake pressure, intake temperature, fuel trim,  throttle position, O2 lambda parameters</li>
<li>Resulting data, e.g.: fuel consumption, CO2 emissions</li>
</ul>
The data is available on your smartphone for your own analysis.    
</p>

<h3>b) Publication of the data using the smartphone app and analysis of the data on the enviroCar server</h3>
<p>By uploading data from the enviroCar app to the enviroCar server (option: 'Upload data as open data'), you agree to have your driving data published in an anonymous form as open data and that we and third parties may use it in accordance with the Open Database License (ODbL). See for more information: <a href="https://www.opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/summary/index.html">www.opendatacommons.org</a></p>
<p>You help scientists and traffic planners gain important data for their work when you publish your data. At the same time, uploading it enables you to use the enviroCar platform's advanced capabilities to analyze your own data.</p>
<p>Your enviroCar account contains a reference to all the tracks you have published as Open Data. As a result, you have the opportunity to manage your own data and analyze it using the platform's resources. You can delete some or all of your driving data from the enviroCar platform at any time. You also have the option to delete your account. All driving data, which have already been downloaded by third parties as Open Data, can still be used by them in accordance with the ODbL.</p>

<h3>c) Use of the published data by third parties</h3>
<p>The data that you have uploaded to the enviroCar server (option: 'Upload driving data as open data') can be downloaded from there via various interfaces may be used by third parties in accordance with the Open Database License (ODbL). We permit the copying of the data, its distribution and the derivation of new data from the database.</p>
<p>When disclosing the data to third parties, you must specify where the data came from ('Source: enviroCar contributors'). Each copied, modified or supplemented version of the database must be made accessible itself in accordance with the ODbL. The ODbL’s binding text can be found <a href="https://www.opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/1.0/">here</a>.</p>   
<p>There is no reference to your account in the driving data that you publish as open data, thus  other users have no information about this relationship. Please note, it may be possible to draw conclusions about the author without this information. The data itself may contain such individual characteristics that a relationship to specific persons is obvious. For example, this is the case when a rare type of vehicle moves between a person’s living and working locations and this person is known to have this type of vehicle.To complicate such conclusions, there is an option to adjust the data recording so that it starts and ends with a minimum distance or duration from the start or destination of your journey.</p>
